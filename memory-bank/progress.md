## Known Issues
*None identified yet - will be updated as development progresses*

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Architecture Decisions
- **Build Tool**: Chose Vite over Webpack for simplicity and speed
- **Framework**: Vanilla TypeScript over React/Vue for bundle size and learning
- **State Management**: Custom observer pattern over external libraries
- **Testing**: Jest + Playwright combination for comprehensive coverage

### Pending Decisions
- **CSS Framework**: Consider Tailwind vs custom CSS for styling
- **Icon Library**: Evaluate options for UI icons (SVG vs icon font)
- **Chart Library**: For statistics visualization (Chart.js vs D3.js vs custom)
- **PWA Features**: Timeline for service worker and offline capabilities

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Browser Compatibility**: Mitigation through progressive enhancement
- **Local Storage Limits**: Mitigation through data compression and cleanup
- **Mobile Performance**: Mitigation through careful optimization and testing

### User Experience Risks
- **Complex Scoring Rules**: Mitigation through clear UI and validation
- **Data Loss**: Mitigation through robust auto-save and export features
- **Field Usability**: Mitigation through extensive mobile testing

## Success Metrics Tracking
- **Development Velocity**: Target 20-30 hours total development time
- **Code Quality**: Maintain 80%+ test coverage for core logic
- **Performance**: Bundle size < 100KB, score input response < 100ms
- **User Experience**: Successful field testing with actual archers

## Next Session Priorities
1. Set up development environment with Vite and TypeScript
2. Create project structure and basic build configuration
3. Implement core type definitions and interfaces
4. Begin foundation services starting with StorageService
